    <h3>About Motor Selection</h3>
    <p>
      Motor selection is one of the most critical steps in drone design, as it
      directly affects thrust, efficiency, stability, and flight safety.
      An undersized motor may cause overheating, loss of lift, or mid-air failure,
      while an oversized motor increases weight and power consumption.
      <br><br>
      This tool helps engineers select motors based on thrust-to-weight ratio,
      battery voltage compatibility, KV rating, and expected current draw.
      It ensures that each motor can safely produce enough thrust while operating
      within electrical and thermal limits.
      <br><br>
      Proper motor selection improves flight endurance, responsiveness,
      and reliability for hobby, research, and delivery drones.
